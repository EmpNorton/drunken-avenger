This is an attempt to host a smaller blog. I don't need all of the
things that Wordpress provides. Additionally since the pages are static,
I benefit from faster page loads. Finally, the security footprint of
the page is smaller.

This method of posting is new to me and I'm having to get used to
deploying the pages using Jekyll.

Thanks for visiting!
