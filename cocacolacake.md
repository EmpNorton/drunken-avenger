title: Coca-Cola Cake
---

## Ingredients

* 2 cups unsifted flour
* 2 cups sugar
* 2 sticks margarine
* 3 Tablespoons unsweetened cocoa
* 1 cup Coca-Cola
* 1/2 cup buttermilk
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 2 eggs beaten
* 1 Tablespoon vanilla
* 1 1/2 cups mini marshmallows

## Method

1. Sift flour and sugar in a bowl.
2. Heat margarine, cocoa, and Coke to boiling point and pour over flour/sugar mixture.
3. Add buttermilk, baking soda, eggs, vanilla, and marshmallows and mix. Batter looks thin and marshmallows will float.
4. Pour batter into oblong, floured and buttered cake pan.
5. Bake @ 350 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes.  (Use toothpicks to tell when done).
6. Ice cake while hot.

## Frosting Ingredients
* 1/2 cup butter or margarine
* 3 Tablespoons unsweetened cocoa
* 6 Tablespoons Coca-Cola
* 1 box Confectioner's sugar
* 1 cup chopped nuts

## Frosting Method

1. Combine butter, cocoa, and Coke and heat to boiling.
2. Pour sugar into bowl and pour hot mixture over sugar.
3. Beat well and add nuts.
4. Pour over HOT cake.


My one complaint with the above frosting is that it is too heavy, more like a fudge than a frosting.  I have been fooling around with the recipe for a frosting and came up with this variation of another recipe.  Instead of frosting the cake hot, you should let it cool in the pan and then use the following frosting.  It is has a richer chocolate flavor and doesn't overpower the cake like the first frosting does. . .

## Alternative Frosting Ingredients:

* 2 Tablespoons sweet butter
* 3/4 cup semi-sweet Chocolate Chips
* 6 Tablespoons Heavy Cream
* 1 1/4 cups sifted Confectioners sugar
* 1 Tablespoon Vanilla
* ~ 3/4 cup chopped walnuts (this is somewhat experimental, but it should be a good starting point)

## Method
1. Combine all ingredients except the nuts into a saucepan over low heat and stir until smooth.
2. Then add the nuts and pour over the COOLED cake.
